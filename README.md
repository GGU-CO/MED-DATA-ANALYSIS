# MED-DATA-ANALYSIS
This Python notebook analyzes medical infrastructure data across India, focusing on hospital and bed availability in rural and urban areas. Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Folium, it turns raw data into insightful visualizations such as charts and geospatial maps.
ðŸ©º Medical Data Analysis and Visualization using Python ðŸ§ª
This project presents a Python notebook designed to perform data analysis and interactive visualization on medical infrastructure data across India. The primary focus is on the availability of hospital beds and facilities in rural and urban areas, which is especially relevant during times of crisis like pandemics or natural disasters.

Developed using powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium, this notebook transforms raw datasets into meaningful visual insights through bar graphs, pie charts, heatmaps, and geospatial visualizations.

ðŸ“Š Features
Analyzes availability of hospitals (primary, community, district) and beds in rural/urban areas.

Visualizes data using:

Bar graphs and pie charts for comparative analysis

Folium maps for geospatial plotting of hospital locations using latitude and longitude

Sorted and ranked listings of states/UTs based on medical facility availability

Identifies states with top medical infrastructure and visualizes trends

Can be extended to track major diseases, availability of medicines, equipment, and specialist doctors

ðŸ§° Technologies & Libraries Used
Python Notebook (developed in Kaggle environment)

NumPy â€“ numerical operations

Pandas â€“ data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ static data visualization

Plotly â€“ interactive charts

Folium â€“ geospatial data visualization

Scikit-learn (sklearn) â€“ ML tasks (expandable)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset consists of government health infrastructure data, including hospital types, bed availability, and facility distribution across Indian states and union territories. Formats supported: .csv, .xlsx.

ðŸ§  Future Scope
Extend to include real-time disease tracking and trend analysis

Include more granular data like availability of specialist doctors, medical equipment, and emergency services

Build a dashboard or web app interface for wider accessibility
