# MED-DATA-ANALYSIS

# 🩺 Medical Data Analysis and Visualization using Python

This project provides a **Python notebook** that analyzes medical infrastructure data in India, focusing on the **availability of hospitals and beds** across rural and urban regions. It helps visualize key insights through charts and geospatial maps, making it a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making, especially during crises like pandemics or natural disasters.

## 📊 Features

- Analyze hospital types: primary, community, and district
- Compare bed availability in rural vs urban areas
- Visualize data with:
  - 📊 Bar and pie charts
  - 🗺️ Interactive maps (using Folium)
- Identify top states/UTs with the best medical infrastructure
- Display top hospitals by bed count and facilities
- Sort and filter data for specific insights

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python (Jupyter/Kaggle Notebooks)**
- **Pandas** – data handling
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – static visualizations
- **Plotly** – interactive charts
- **Folium** – geographic data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – (expandable for ML tasks)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes details of hospital facilities, types, and bed counts across Indian states and UTs. Formats supported: `.csv`, `.xlsx`. You can use publicly available data or upload your own.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Disease tracking and hotspot visualization
- Insights on availability of specialist doctors and equipment
- Web-based dashboard for wider accessibility
